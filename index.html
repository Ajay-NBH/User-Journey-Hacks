    <title>Precision Playbook: Interactive Growth Strategies</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy & Grounded (#F7F3E9 as base, #A88B79 as primary, #D4B2A5 as secondary, #5F4B42 as text, #E47A6F as accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is an interactive dashboard to explore a large database of 100+ growth hacks. The structure is built around a powerful filtering system, allowing users to navigate by funnel stage (Attract, Convert, etc.), effort level, and service type. This task-oriented design is superior to a linear report for a playbook of this size, as it allows product managers or marketers to quickly isolate specific, actionable ideas (e.g., find all "No-Code" hacks for "High-Consideration" services). The core interaction is a grid of flippable "hack cards" which present concise information on the front and detailed implementation notes on the back, enabling rapid scanning and deep dives. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application synthesizes themes from the qualitative report. 1) Goal: Compare & Prioritize -> Viz: An interactive bubble chart plots Effort vs. a derived "Impact" score for different strategy categories, helping users spot quick wins. 2) Goal: Compare -> Viz: A stacked bar chart contrasts the primary conversion goals (e.g., "Speed," "Trust") for Low vs. High-Consideration services. 3) Goal: Organize -> Viz: The entire user journey is represented by the main navigation, acting as a functional flow diagram. These visualizations transform the dense text of the report into scannable, strategic frameworks, confirming NO SVG/Mermaid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
